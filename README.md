Hello, Welcome!

Here is my place where you can see the logical implementations for problems.

This will contain a specific folders for each problems / logic's, solved using possible algorithms.

About algorithms, my understandings below


Algorithm is a set of well defined process or set of rules followed in-order to solve the problems in an easiest way.

We can come up with any algorithms to solve particular problems but one of the most important aspects to consider is about
run time, how fast it is. But if the algorithm is too slow then again it's back to hell.

By considering a run time analysis in a problem, algorithm makes the executions very faster.

Approximate completion time for algorithms, N = 100


O(Log(N)) 	10^-7 seconds

O(N) 	    10^-6 seconds

O(N*Log(N)) 10^-5 seconds

O(N^2) 	    10^-4 seconds

O(N^6) 	    3 minutes

O(2^N) 	    10^14 years.

O(N!) 	    10^142 years.
